Delivery companies such as \textit{La Poste} to deliver parcels or \textit{Total} to supply petrol service stations need to plan their deliveries to make them optimal. According to researchers {\sc Geir Hasle} and {\sc Knut-Andreas Lie}, the use of algorithms would enable these companies to make savings of 5\%. These carriers have one major constraint : their trucks have a limited loading capacity. This planning problem is referred to in the literature as \textbf{CVRP} : Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. \\
We deal only with the special case where each vehicle has a unique loading capacity and starts from the same depot to make its deliveries, then returns to it at the end of its tour.
