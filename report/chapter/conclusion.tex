Our program is now ready to be used to determine the minimum delivery cost for a given number of customers, and to indicate the different routes to be taken.

To carry out this project, we first went through a phase of analysis, design and then testing. In order to be able to work easily together, we divided our project into several distinct files, and precise specifications had to be defined for each of them. Modifications were then tracked using the Git version management system.

This project, which required skills in graphing, combinatorics and data structure, was very rewarding. Not only did it enable us to consolidate our knowledge in these two disciplines, but it also enabled us to develop skills to better manage a project. For example, we now know how to divide up a project so that we can work together, and we better understand the usefulness of writing specifications.
